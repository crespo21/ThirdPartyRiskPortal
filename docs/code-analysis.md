### ⚠️ Issues Identified

#### 1. Schema Organization Problem (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Pydantic schemas are mixed with SQLAlchemy models in `models.py`, while `schemas.py` is empty.

**Issues**:
- Violates separation of concerns principle
- Makes code harder to maintain and understand
- Can cause confusion between ORM models and API schemas
- May lead to FastAPI `response_model` errors

**Impact**: This is likely the root cause of import and response_model errors mentioned in the conversation summary.

#### 2. Router Implementation Inconsistencies
**Issues Found**:
- **Missing Pydantic schema usage** in several routers (company.py, assessments.py, tasks.py)
- **Inconsistent parameter handling** - some use individual parameters, others use schemas
- **Missing response_model declarations** in many endpoints
- **No input validation** in several endpoints

**Examples**:
```python
# Current (problematic)
@router.post("/")
def create_company(name: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):

# Should be
@router.post("/", response_model=CompanyResponse)
def create_company(company: CompanyCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
```

#### 3. Error Handling Gaps
- **Inconsistent error responses** across endpoints
- **Missing validation error handling** in some routers
- **No standardized error response format**
- **Limited error context** in some exception handlers

#### 4. Security Improvements Needed
- **Hardcoded credentials** in auth.py (demo purposes but should be improved)
- **Missing rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
- **No password complexity validation**
- **Limited user session management**

#### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **No visible test files** in the current structure
- **Missing unit tests** for critical business logic
- **No integration tests** for API endpoints
- **No test coverage reporting**

#### 6. Documentation Gaps
- **Missing API endpoint documentation** (though auto-generated OpenAPI helps)
- **No code comments** in complex business logic
- **Limited inline documentation** for service classes
