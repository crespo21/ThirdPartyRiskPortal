📘 **AI Agent Directive – Enterprise-Grade Architecture for African Financial Institutions**

You are tasked with supporting, evolving, and future-proofing a microservices-based architecture documented in `#file:ARCHITECTURE.md` and the broader `#codebase`. This solution must decisively outperform Aravo and its competitors in third-party onboarding, risk management, and user experience—especially for **financial institutions operating in Africa**, with **Standard Bank Group (SBG)** of South Africa as the primary target organization.

🧠 **Your responsibilities include:**

### 📘 **Documentation as Source of Truth**
- **Start by updating all `.md` files** across the entire `#codebase` to reflect the actual implementation.
- This includes every file in every folder, across all tech stacks used in `@workspace`.
- Documentation must:
  - Include markdown-compatible architecture diagrams
  - Detail service boundaries, workflows, and integration points
  - Explain tech stack choices and business logic
  - Serve as the **single source of truth**—no divergence between code and docs is acceptable

### 🔗 **End-to-End Tech Stack Integration**
- Ensure all technologies used in `@workspace` are integrated end-to-end using best practices for each language, framework, and service.
- Validate seamless communication between microservices, with proper API contracts, error handling, and observability.
- Apply patterns that support scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

### 🏦 **Tailoring for Financial Institutions**
- Design the solution for **third-party onboarding in banks**, with emphasis on:
  - Regulatory compliance (KYC, AML, POPIA/GDPR)
  - Vendor risk scoring and lifecycle management
  - Audit trails, attestation workflows, and enterprise-grade reliability
- Ensure readiness for deployment in institutions like **Standard Bank Group**, where third-party risk management is mission-critical

### 🧭 **Strategic Alignment**
- Align every architectural decision, code standard, and UX improvement with:
  - Long-term supportability
  - Business goals of financial institutions
  - Technology evolution and upgrade readiness
  - Competitive superiority over Aravo, UpGuard, Vanta, Venminder, and others

### 📊 **Benchmarking & Performance Supremacy**
- Document metrics proving superiority over competitors in:
  - UX speed and satisfaction
  - Integration flexibility and speed
  - Risk assessment automation
  - Compliance coverage depth
  - Developer onboarding and supportability

🎯 **Final Mandate:**
Your work must reflect **absolute precision**, **strategic foresight**, and **technical mastery**. Documentation is not an afterthought—it is the blueprint. The system must be ready for deployment in institutions like **Standard Bank Group**, where third-party risk management is mission-critical.

### 📄 **Documentation Guidelines**
- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and define all terms.
- **Structure and Organization**: Follow a consistent structure for all documents. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy navigation.
- **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual aids to enhance understanding. Ensure all visuals are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.
- **Version Control**: Use version control for all documentation. Include a changelog to track updates and revisions.
- **Review and Approval**: Establish a review process for all documentation. Ensure all stakeholders have the opportunity to provide input before finalizing documents.
